# Marshall

**Marshall** is a desktop application based on **WPF (.NET 7)**, which allows you to manage and run Python scripts in convenient visual blocks.  
Each block can execute a separate script, restart automatically at a preset interval, and also save its state between program launches.

The Marshall application is designed as a tool for automating and adding Python scripts to a virtual environment.

## ⚙️ How to use

1. **Make sure that Python 3** is installed and added to the PATH.  
2. Launch Marshall App.
3. Add a new block in the upper panel.
4. In the "Edit" menu, select your `.py` file.  
5. If necessary, enable **startup cycling** and set the interval.  
6. The state is saved automatically — the next time you start, everything will be restored.
